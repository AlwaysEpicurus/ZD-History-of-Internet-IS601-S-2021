            <h3>Yahoo</h3>
            <p>Jerry Yang and David Filo founded Yahoo at Stanford University.
                The idea for Yahoo came up when they were trying to gather information on the internet to support their
                Fantasy Basketball League.
                David found a way to pool information (a directory) about a previous night’s game and analyze the data to
                help them make their Fantasy Team decisions.
                Initial investors include Michael Moritz of famed VC Sequoia Capital.
                An initial challenge was monetization. Making money off the web was seen as antithetical to the internet by
                many at the time. Before Yahoo! there was very little commerce on the web.
                The solution was advertising. In late 1995 they launched banner ads with much success.</p>
            <h3>Search Challengers</h3>
            <p>There were many early challengers to Yahoo (Infoseek, AltaVista, Lycos), but none as formidable as
                Excite.</p>
            <h4>Excite</h4>

            <p>Founded by Joe Kraus at Stanford
                Excite used a web crawler to scrape the web for pages based on the terms of the search query
                Instead of the Yahoo model, a list of sites type sorted by hand, Excite was pure software-driven.</p>

            <h3>Search Wars</h3>
            <p>During the late 90s, competition among search-companies was heating up.
                They were fighting to become portals and one-stop destinations for the millions of people coming online.
                Each company would launch service after service, copying each other to remain competitive.
                In the process, they lost sight of Search.</p>


            <h3>Google</h3>
            <h4>Google’s Genesis</h4>
            <p>Despite new features coming out of the search wards of the late 90s, the actual search experience was still
                lacking. People couldn’t find what they were looking for online.
                Larry Page and Sergey Brin founded Google at Stanford University in 1998
                Google based its search on the idea that a site’s relevance could be judged by how many pages link to it. In
                a sense, each site would vote on the significance of another site by linking to it. The more votes, the
                higher the relevance, the higher it ranked.</p>

            <h4>Google’s Early Days</h4>
            <h5>Meeting with Excite</h5>
            <p>Vinod Khosla (co-founder of Sun Microsystems) introduced Larry and Sergey to Excite CTO, but nothing ever
                came of it.</p>

            <h5>Initial Funding</h5>
            <p>Andy Bechtolsheim wrote a check to Google for $100,000 right after seeing a demo for the first time. Other
                Angel investors followed Any investing a total of $1,000,000
                Early VC included L. John Doerr of Kleiner Perkins who invested $12M, and Sequoias who matched Doerr’s
                investment.</p>

            <h5>Initial Monetization Challenge</h5>
            <p>Like Yahoo! Google had a monetization challenge. They didn’t want an overly visual advertising model as
                Yahoo! and the rest had. They wanted something inline with their simple aesthetic and user-friendliness.
                Google created AdWords, copying an idea from Bill Gross, who built a company, Overture, to capitalize on
                keywords. The thinking was that keywords could be monetized much like the yellow pages. Gross proposed that
                Keywords not only represented what people were searching for but what they wanted to purchase. They would
                later pay Bill Gross a settlement concluding a lawsuit.</p>

            <h5>IPO</h5>
            <p>On August 19, 2004, with $3 billion in revenue, Google went public with an IPO on the NASDAQ stock
                market.</p></div>
