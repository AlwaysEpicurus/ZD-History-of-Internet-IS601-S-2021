        <h3>The Birth of Mosaic Online</h3>
            <p>	The World Wide Web was a tremendous unknown when it was created in 1989 by an English scientist named
            Tim Berners-Lee. The World Wide Web consisted of a very few pages with loads of text on it not worth finding
            , and for the lucky few to use it there was no easy way to be able to find these web pages. This would all
            change when Marc Andreessen, along with a few of his college friends, decided to change the internet
            landscape forever by creating the first graphical web browser: Mosaic Online. In the fall of 1993,
            Andreessen and company released Mosaic Online, which was a freely downloadable gift for all. To create
            awareness of Mosaic Online, Andreessen decided to make an announcement on a newsnet news group for those
            interested in being a part of a beta effort. From this announcement, 12 people responded and were sent the
            first browser. This initial group would grow rapidly as news of Mosaic Online would spread, reaching
            millions of people within a short timeline. </p>

             <div class=" p-2 mb-2 bg-light text-dark">
        <h3>Netscape comes to being</h3>
            <p>News of Mosaic Online would quickly reach Jim Clark, a Stanford professor and Co-Founder of Netscape.
            Clark would approach Andreessen for a business partnership to continue on the success of Mosaic Online, and
            the duo would soon gather a group of engineers to create Netscape. The creation of Netscape would become
            worrisome for major tech companies, including Microsoft.</p>
             </div>
             <div class=" p-2 mb-2 bg-light text-dark">
        <h3>A Threat to Microsoft</h3>
            <p>Bill Gates, founder and CEO of Microsoft at the time, saw Netscape as a threat to their technological
            supremacy, since by 1993, about 90% of the world’s PCs were running Microsoft software, and Netscape were
            cutting into their reign. On top of this, Gates knew that at some point a small startup would come in to the
            tech landscape and topple Microsoft as the leader in technology/browser supremacy, which Microsoft had done
            years prior. On October 13th, 1994, Netscape would launch its own web browser for use: Navigator. From here,
            the internet landscape would change forever, as more and more people would use these web browsers in their
            daily lives. Navigator would soon challenge Microsoft’s software platform supremacy, and force Gates to
            rethink the impact the web would have on daily life, and forced Microsoft engineers to fight back.</p>

             <div class=" p-2 mb-2 bg-light text-dark">
        <h3>The Browser Wars Begin</h3>
            <p> Knowing Microsoft would soon be coming after them, Netscape would hire Gary Reback, an anti-trust lawyer, to
            represent them in the event Microsoft would do anything illegal. After receiving threats from Microsoft,
            Reback would soon alert the Department of Justice to look into the practices of Microsoft, which would spell
            trouble for Microsoft. Soon after, Netscape would go public, further igniting the internet boom. After some
            inflammatory comments from Andreessen, Microsoft set its sights on their own web browser: Internet Explorer.
            What would ensue would be a bitter back-and-forth between the two web browsers. Gates would use all
            Microsoft engineers on Internet Explorer, and would use their businessmen to ensure that all computer
            manufacturers would ship only Internet Explorer, and prevent installing anything but Internet Explorer. By
            September of 1997, Netscape would lose the browser wars, but Windows would face another threat: the U.S.
            government. </p>

             <div class=" p-2 mb-2 bg-light text-dark">
        <h3>Anti-Trust Problems</h3>
            <p>Gates would face a massive anti-trust lawsuit, being accused of forcing consumers to use
            Internet Explorer, and no other web browser. After a lengthy trial, and almost having Microsoft being split
            into two, Gates would pass over the CEO position to Steve Ballmer. However, the impact of these browser wars
            would later bring on other companies, such as Google.</p>
