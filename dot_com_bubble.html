        <h3>Into the Unknown - Amazon and eBay</h3>
        <p>Before the advent of the internet, no one would have thought that the World Wide Web would have such an
            impact on our daily lives. However, with the arrivals of eBay and Amazon, this sentiment would soon change,
            as it would change the face of commerce forever. With these two companies, the focus would focus on the
            customers being an integral part of the business’s success. Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, saw the
            enormous potential the internet had. He began work on creating lists of items that would be ideal for selling.
            The one constant he found were books, and he saw that there were millions of printed books that could in turn
            be sold online that would be able to help millions, since it would be impossible to house all of those books
            in a physical bookstore. He would launch Amazon in the summer of 1995. Pierre Omidyar, the founder of eBay,
            would launch the site in part because he thought an online auction site would be a cool idea to do and level
            the playing field for all. Over a holiday weekend, Omidyar would create and launch eBay. Both saw the massive
            potential the internet had in changing the way people saw commerce. However, the two were different in that
            Bezos was more business inclined and Omidyar was more technologically inclined. Although they were different
            in mindset, they were both successful in part because customers would quickly use these e-commerce sites.</p>
        <h3>Innovations in Technology</h3>
        <p>The internet boom would get a massive boost with the innovation of the silicon chip. Silicon chips would have
            a major part in the growth of the internet, as Moore’s Law, where the number of transistors on a microchip
            doubles every year, would change computers forever. With Metcalf’s Law, where every node in the network would
            increase the networks value dramatically. In other words, the internet gathers momentum as more and more users
            join the network. This would only be more prevalent as technology would become faster and cheaper.</p>
        <h3>The Internet Bubble Grows...and Pops</h3>
        <p>This huge growth would lead to a growth of an internet bubble. Amazon would soon be a pioneer in the internet
            boom, and would use the words “Get Big Fast” as words to live by. With the growth of e-commerce came worries
            with security. However, with symmetric key cryptography, e-commerce would receive near perfect security, and
            more customers flocked to sites like Amazon. With eBay, there were doubts with how impactful it could be.
            Once it went public, however, eBay’s stocks soared and showed just how big e-commerce sites such as eBay and
            Amazon really were. Now, more people were telling their brokers to invest in any dot com sites, making the
            dot com bubble even bigger. In turn, more people were trying to create their own businesses to latch on to
            the internet/dot com gold rush success. However, most of the new business ventures were more stupid ideas,
            rather than thought out ideas. This created a spending frenzy, and no one knew who would thrive, and who
            would fade into obscurity. The telecommunication bubble came as a result of customers needing more bandwidth
            to be able to surf the internet. However, no one thought of the consequences of the number of resources and
            spending went into creating this network. On April 14th, 2000, the internet economy would crash, and be
            known as “Black Friday”. The Nasdaq would drop 355 points and fell 25%, which would be the biggest collapse
            of the stock market to that point. </p>
        <h3>Rising From the Ashes</h3>
        <p>Even with the pop of the internet bubble, this led to a fundamentally different way of thinking in terms of
            communications, technology, and e-commerce. Amazon and eBay showed that empowering normal people is the
            reason why they stuck around even after the crash. They set a new standard for customers in that they were
            in the driver’s seat, and no longer the businesses. The bubble also built out the network infrastructure,
            and with the craze the network infrastructure was built much quicker, and forced brick-and-mortar stores to
            adapt to the evolution of the internet.</p>
