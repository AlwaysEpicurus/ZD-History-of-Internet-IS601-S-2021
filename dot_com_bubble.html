            <h3>Into the Unknown - Amazon and eBay</h3>
            <p>Before the advent of the internet, no one would have thought that the World Wide Web would have such an
                impact on our daily lives. However, with the arrivals of eBay and Amazon, this sentiment would soon
                change,
                as it would change the face of commerce forever. With these two companies, the focus would focus on the
                customers being an integral part of the business’s success. Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, saw the
                enormous potential the internet had. He began work on creating lists of items that would be ideal for
                selling.
                The one constant he found were books, and he saw that there were millions of printed books that could in
                turn
                be sold online that would be able to help millions, since it would be impossible to house all of those
                books
                in a physical bookstore. He would launch Amazon in the summer of 1995. Pierre Omidyar, the founder of
                eBay,
                would launch the site in part because he thought an online auction site would be a cool idea to do and
                level
                the playing field for all. Over a holiday weekend, Omidyar would create and launch eBay. Both saw the
                massive
                potential the internet had in changing the way people saw commerce. However, the two were different in
                that
                Bezos was more business inclined and Omidyar was more technologically inclined. Although they were
                different
                in mindset, they were both successful in part because customers would quickly use these e-commerce
                sites.</p>

        <div class=" p-2 mb-2 bg-light text-dark">
            <h3>Innovations in Technology</h3>
            <p>The internet boom would get a massive boost with the innovation of the silicon chip. Silicon chips would
                have
                a major part in the growth of the internet, as Moore’s Law, where the number of transistors on a
                microchip
                doubles every year, would change computers forever. With Metcalf’s Law, where every node in the network
                would
                increase the networks value dramatically. In other words, the internet gathers momentum as more and more
                users
                join the network. This would only be more prevalent as technology would become faster and cheaper.</p>

        <div class=" p-2 mb-2 bg-light text-dark">
            <h3>The Internet Bubble Grows...and Pops</h3>
            <p>This huge growth would lead to a growth of an internet bubble. Amazon would soon be a pioneer in the
                internet
                boom, and would use the words “Get Big Fast” as words to live by. With the growth of e-commerce came
                worries
                with security. However, with symmetric key cryptography, e-commerce would receive near perfect security,
                and
                more customers flocked to sites like Amazon. With eBay, there were doubts with how impactful it could
                be.
                Once it went public, however, eBay’s stocks soared and showed just how big e-commerce sites such as eBay
                and
                Amazon really were. Now, more people were telling their brokers to invest in any dot com sites, making
                the
                dot com bubble even bigger. In turn, more people were trying to create their own businesses to latch on
                to
                the internet/dot com gold rush success. However, most of the new business ventures were more stupid
                ideas,
                rather than thought out ideas. This created a spending frenzy, and no one knew who would thrive, and who
                would fade into obscurity. The telecommunication bubble came as a result of customers needing more
                bandwidth
                to be able to surf the internet. However, no one thought of the consequences of the number of resources
                and
                spending went into creating this network. On April 14th, 2000, the internet economy would crash, and be
                known as “Black Friday”. The Nasdaq would drop 355 points and fell 25%, which would be the biggest
                collapse
                of the stock market to that point. </p>

        <div class=" p-2 mb-2 bg-light text-dark">
            <h3>Rising From the Ashes</h3>
            <p>Even with the pop of the internet bubble, this led to a fundamentally different way of thinking in terms
                of
                communications, technology, and e-commerce. Amazon and eBay showed that empowering normal people is the
                reason why they stuck around even after the crash. They set a new standard for customers in that they
                were
                in the driver’s seat, and no longer the businesses. The bubble also built out the network
                infrastructure,
                and with the craze the network infrastructure was built much quicker, and forced brick-and-mortar stores
                to
                adapt to the evolution of the internet.</p>
